# Decision Log

This file records architectural and implementation decisions using a list format.
2025-08-15 20:16:51 - Initialized from docs/prd.md via Initiate Memory Bank (command "i").

*

## Decision

- 2025-08-15 20:16:51 - Initialize Memory Bank seeded from PRD to establish shared, persistent project context.

## Rationale 

- Centralize context to avoid drift across modes and stages.
- Provide authoritative source for goals, scope, and staged plan from PRD.
- Enable traceability for future architectural choices.

## Implementation Details

- Created productContext.md summarizing PRD goals, scope, architecture, and stages.
- Created activeContext.md for current focus, recent changes, and open questions.
- Created progress.md for task tracking and next steps.

## Decision

- 2025-08-15 20:33:03 - Create public GitHub repository and initialize with comprehensive project setup

## Rationale 

- Establish public presence for Nova Brief project with professional repository structure
- Enable community engagement through GitHub features (stars, forks, issues, discussions)
- Provide centralized location for all project documentation and code
- Set foundation for open source collaboration and transparency

## Implementation Details

- Created repository at https://github.com/BioInfo/nova-brief with engaging description
- Added comprehensive .gitignore for Python development
- Added MIT LICENSE for open source collaboration
- Created feature-rich README.md with badges, star chart, architecture overview, and development roadmap
- Committed and pushed all documentation (19 files, 3,295 lines) including complete planning specs and Memory Bank
- Repository ready for Stage 1 MVP implementation


## Decision

- 2025-08-16 04:33:29 - Completed Nova Brief MVP implementation with full agent pipeline and uv environment management

## Rationale 

- Successfully delivered all 9 planned MVP components meeting PRD Stage 1 acceptance criteria
- Restructured project to follow Python best practices with uv for dependency management
- Implemented complete end-to-end research pipeline with proper separation of concerns
- Added comprehensive testing and evaluation framework for quality assurance

## Implementation Details

- Core Architecture: Planner → Searcher → Reader → Analyst → Verifier → Writer agent pipeline
- Technology Stack: Python 3.11+, Streamlit UI, Cerebras GPT-OSS-120B via OpenAI client, uv dependency management
- Module Structure: src/ package with agent/, tools/, providers/, observability/ submodules
- Testing: Comprehensive test suite with 4 validation areas: file structure, configuration, evaluation topics, module imports
- Deployment Ready: pyproject.toml configuration, setup scripts, and .env.example template
- Quality Gates: All tests passing, proper error handling for missing API keys, structured logging and tracing
- Evaluation Framework: 10 diverse test topics covering complexity levels from medium to high

## Next Steps

- Stage 2 (Robustness): Add async processing, deduplication, quality gates, SQLite caching, Pydantic v2 schemas
- Production deployment with real Cerebras API key and search provider configuration
- Performance optimization and scaling for concurrent usage
