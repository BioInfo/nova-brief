- 2025-08-19 01:06:11 - Initialized Memory Bank (productContext.md, activeContext.md)

## Current Tasks

- 2025-08-20 19:12:39 - Phase 3: Implement routing modes (manual | policy | hybrid) with env overrides and provider model_key support
- 2025-08-20 19:12:39 - Phase 3: Orchestrator/agents wiring to pass explicit model_key per stage (start with Writer, then Critic, then Planner/Analyst/Verifier)
- 2025-08-20 19:12:39 - Phase 4: Add LLM-as-Judge scoring in eval/harness.py and generate PDF via eval/report_generator.py
- 2025-08-20 19:12:39 - Phase 4: Add critic.review gating flow (two-pass writer) with robust JSON parsing and safe fallbacks

## Next Steps

- 2025-08-20 19:12:39 - UI: Add Routing selector (Manual/Policy/Hybrid) and optional per-agent preview
- 2025-08-20 19:12:39 - Config: Add effective_routing_mode() and ENV overrides for POLICY_AGENT_MODELS_*

## Phase 4 Implementation Completed - 2025-08-20 20:28:30
