# Deep Research Agent — Comprehensive Planning Document

2025-08-15 20:18:05 - Initialized from docs/prd.md and Memory Bank.

This document operationalizes the PRD into an executable plan: architecture, specifications, APIs, data models, UX, testing, observability, security, ops, performance, cost, risks, backlog, and milestones. It is the single source of truth for Stage 1–4 delivery.

## 1) Executive summary

Build a fast, reliable deep-research agent that plans, searches, reads, verifies, and writes cited briefs. Ship an MVP in Python with Streamlit, using Cerebras GPT-OSS-120B through OpenRouter's OpenAI-compatible API, pinned exclusively to the Cerebras provider. Scale through robustness, orchestration, and a polished web app, optimizing for throughput, reliability, observability, and cost.

---

## 2) Product scope and requirements traceability

- Outputs: 800–1,200 word analyst-grade briefs in Markdown with numbered citations and a References section.
- Claims policy: All non-obvious claims must have ≥1 source; target ≥2 for 60%+ by Stage 4.
- Tooling: web_search, fetch_url (HTML), parse_pdf; enforce robots.txt.
- Limits: max search rounds, per-domain caps, request timeouts; configurable via config file and UI.
- Observability: token counts, time, source counts, domain diversity; logs and traces.

Traceability matrix (high-level):
- PRD Goals → Sections in this plan
  - Analyst-grade briefs → Writer spec, Evaluation plan
  - Claim coverage enforcement → Verifier spec, Evaluation metrics
  - Speed/cost visibility → Observability, Performance, Cost model
  - MVP limits → MVP scope, Acceptance criteria

---

## 3) System architecture

Runtime path (MVP → Scale):
- Client UI (Streamlit) → Backend service (/run) → Agent loop (Planner → Searcher → Reader → Analyst → Verifier → Writer) → OpenRouter API (/chat/completions) + search/fetch tools → SQLite cache (Stage 2+) → Storage (reports)
- Model: openai/gpt-oss-120b via OpenRouter. Configure client with base_url="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1" and OPENROUTER_API_KEY. The client must enforce Cerebras-only routing.

Key architectural tenets:
- Deterministic orchestration with explicit tool-call boundaries.
- Caching-first I/O; robust retries/backoff; per-domain rate limits (Stage 2).
- Explicit state objects flowing across components to enable tracing and evaluation.
- Pluggable providers (search engines; later orchestration engines).

---

## 4) Component specifications

Note: No code here to keep this document language-agnostic.

- Planner
  - Input: topic, constraints, prior knowledge (optional)
  - Output: sub-questions and initial search queries; stopping criteria
  - Rules: generate diverse queries (operator variants, site/domain filters if constraints provided)
- Searcher
  - Input: queries, k, provider config
  - Output: SearchResult[] {title, url, snippet}
  - Rules: enforce per-domain caps, normalize URLs, dedupe at URL level
- Reader
  - Input: URLs
  - Output: Document[] {url, title, text, source_meta}
  - Rules: fetch with headers; respect robots.txt; extract main content (HTML), parse PDF; chunk (by tokens)
- Analyst
  - Input: Chunks grouped by document; plan/sub-questions; constraints
  - Output: claims, interim citations, synthesis notes
  - Rules: ensure traceability for claim → source
- Verifier
  - Input: Draft sections, claims, citations, corpus
  - Output: unsupported claims list; follow-up queries; remediation suggestions
  - Rules: zero orphan claims before finalization
- Writer
  - Input: verified outline/sections/citations
  - Output: final Markdown brief + References list; optional JSON report
  - Rules: Leverage OpenRouter's support for structured output by providing a JSON Schema for the final Report object. This ensures validated, machine-readable output.

Cross-cutting:
- Dedupe: URL normalization, text SimHash/MinHash (Stage 2)
- Quality gate: domain allow/deny, language filter, length thresholds (Stage 2)
- Caching: SQLite for pages and traces (Stage 2)
- Orchestration: LangGraph for explicit plan/tool/verify loops (Stage 3)

---

## 5) Data model (Stage 2+ formalization)

- SearchResult { title, url, snippet }
- Document { url, title, text, source_meta }
- Chunk { doc_url, text, hash, tokens }
- Claim { id, text, type, confidence }
- Citation { claim_id, urls[] }
- Report { topic, outline, sections[], citations[], references[] }
- TraceEvent { ts, kind, payload }
- Config { search_provider, k, max_rounds, caps, timeouts }

Notes:
- In Stage 1, typed dicts are sufficient; Stage 2 moves to Pydantic v2 for validation and JSON export stability.
- Hashes used for dedupe and cache keys (e.g., sha256 of normalized text).

---

## 6) Tooling and provider interfaces

- web_search
  - Inputs: query (string), k (int), provider (enum), date_range (optional)
  - Output: SearchResult[]
- fetch_url
  - Inputs: url (string), timeout, headers
  - Output: { html or text, meta }
- parse_pdf
  - Inputs: url or bytes
  - Output: text + meta

Provider abstraction:
- Search providers: DuckDuckGo (default for MVP) → Tavily/Bing/Brave plugs later
- Model provider: OpenAI-compatible client pointing at OpenRouter.
  - base_url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
  - api_key: OPENROUTER_API_KEY
  - model: "openai/gpt-oss-120b"
  - Routing: All requests must include parameters to pin the provider to Cerebras (e.g., {"providers": ["cerebras"]} in the request body).

---

## 7) API specification

- POST /run
  - Body: { topic, constraints?, config? }
  - Returns: { report_md, report_json (optional in MVP), metrics: { duration_s, tokens_in, tokens_out, cost_est } }
- GET /runs/:id
  - Returns: prior result + trace (Stage 3)

HTTP behaviors:
- Idempotency for /run per topic+config hash (if cached and allowed).
- Request IDs in headers; map to traces.

---

## 8) UX flows

MVP (Streamlit):
- Text area for topic
- Optional: constraints panel (date range, include/exclude domains)
- “Run” button
- Status log (tool calls, pages fetched, token/costs)
- Markdown output with citations and References
- Download buttons: .md (and .json later)

Stage 3–4 (Next.js):
- Left: plan/logs/errors; Right: live draft + citations
- Evidence map: claims vs sources; coverage heatmap
- Inline citation preview on hover
- Keyboard shortcuts: Cmd/Ctrl+Enter to run

---

## 9) Observability

- Logs: structured JSON; include request_id, topic_hash, timings, tokens, sources count, cache hits/misses
- Traces: TraceEvent stream persisted to SQLite (Stage 2) and optionally exported via OpenTelemetry (Stage 3)
- Metrics: evaluation harness metrics (time, tokens, sources, domain diversity, dead-link rate, claim coverage, duplication)

---

## 10) Security and compliance

- Respect robots.txt and site terms
- Do not store raw pages beyond cache; store extracted text + URL + hash
- Secret management via environment variables; never hardcode
- PII: avoid collecting; encrypt uploads at rest; redact sensitive URL params in logs

---

## 11) Operations

- Configuration: .env for keys and caps
- Concurrency/backpressure: limit concurrent runs; queue overflow with clear errors
- Cost guardrails: per-run token ceilings; org caps (Stage 4)
- Health checks: provider reachability; search provider fallback/rotation

---

## 12) Performance strategy

- MVP latency target: ≤6 minutes for 2–3 search rounds
- Stage 4 target: 60–90 seconds typical via:
  - Parallel search+fetch
  - Aggressive caching with warm starts
  - Streaming at ~3,000 tok/s on Cerebras
  - Early-write while reading continues (progressive drafting)

---

## 13) Cost model

- Track tokens_in/tokens_out, duration_s, per-run cost estimate
- Pre-run cost estimate: planned rounds × avg tokens × unit cost
- Guardrails: ceiling enforced; user-visible

---

## 14) Risks and mitigations

- Paywalls/anti-bot → summaries, public alternates, user PDFs
- Source spam → domain quality scores, allow/deny
- Hallucinated citations → resolve URLs; quote-match spot checks
- Provider changes → abstraction layers and health checks
- Cost overruns → ceilings; pre-run estimates

---

## 15) Validation and evaluation

Harness:
- 10 fixed topics (technical, policy, biomedical mix)
- Metrics: time, tokens, sources count, domain diversity, dead-link rate, claim coverage, duplication
- Weekly regression run; alarms on threshold drops

Acceptance criteria:
- MVP: ≥5 reputable sources; zero orphan claims on sample topics; <6 min end-to-end on standard query
- Stage 3: repeatability (variance only on changed sources), 5 concurrent runs without timeouts
- Stage 4: UX <2 min to run/export; ≥90% non-obvious claims have ≥1 source; ≥60% have ≥2
